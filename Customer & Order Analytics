#"In this SQL project, I harness the power of querying a multi-table database to derive comprehensive statistical insights into customer behavior and order dynamics.

#Question #1
#How many orders were placed in January?

SELECT COUNT(orderid)
FROM BIT_DB.JanSales
WHERE length(orderid)=6
AND orderid <> 'Order ID'


#Question #2
#How many of those orders were for an iPhone?

SELECT COUNT(orderid)
FROM BIT_DB.JanSales
WHERE Product ='iphone'
AND length(orderid)=6
AND orderid <> 'Order ID'


#Question #3
#Select the customer account numbers for all the orders that were placed in February.

SELECT distinct acctnum
FROM BIT_DB.customers cust
INNER JOIN BIT_DB.FebSales Feb
ON cust.order_id=FEB.orderid
WHERE length(orderid)=6
AND orderid<> 'Order ID';


#Question #4
#Which product was the cheapest one sold in January, and what was the price?

SELECT DISTINCT Product,price
FROM BIT_DB.JanSales
WHERE price IN(SELECT MIN(price)FROM BIT_DB.JanSales);


#Question #5
#What is the total revenue for each product sold in January?

SELECT SUM(quantity)*price AS Revenue,product
FROM BIT_DB.JanSales
GROUP BY product;

#Question #6
#Which products were sold in February at 548 Lincoln St, Seattle, WA 98101,how many of each were sold, and what was the total revenue?

SELECT SUM(quantity),product,SUM(quantity)*price AS revenue
FROM BIT_DB.FebSales
WHERE location= '548 Lincoln St, Seattle, WA 98101'
GROUP BY product;


#Question #7
#How many customers ordered more than 2 products at a time in February,and what was the average amount spent for those customers?

SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT cust.acctnum),AVG(quantity*price)
FROM BIT_DB.FebSales Feb
LEFT JOIN BIT_DB.customers cust
ON FEB.orderid=cust.order_id
WHERE FEB.Quantity>2
AND length(orderid)=6
AND orderid<> 'Order ID';

#Bonus Question:List all the products sold in Los Angeles in February, and include how many of each were sold.

SELECT Product, SUM(quantity)
FROM BIT_DB.FebSales
WHERE location like '%Los Angeles%'
GROUP BY Product;
